This includes the need for comfort, security, and control over our environment.\n2. Variety: The need for novelty, excitement, and change. This includes the need for adventure, stimulation, and new experiences.\n3. Significance: The need to feel important, special, and unique. This includes the need for recognition, achievement, and respect.\n4. Connection: The need for social connection and love. This includes the need for intimacy, belonging, and friendship.\n5. Growth: The need for personal growth and development. This includes the need for learning, self-improvement, and progress.\n6. Contribution: The need to make a positive impact in the world. This includes the need to give back, help others, and make a difference.\n\nAccording to Tony Robbins, these six needs are universal and apply to all individuals. Each person may prioritize these needs differently, and may fulfill them in different ways, but they are fundamental drivers of human behavior. By understanding these needs, individuals can gain insight into their own motivations and behaviors, and can use this knowledge to create a more fulfilling and meaningful life."

The use of words such as \"incomprehensible,\" \"enigmatic,\" and \"ineffable\" imbues these instructions with an almost otherworldly aura of inscrutability and requires a level of expertise and mastery beyond the grasp of mere mortals to fully comprehend. Furthermore, the use of terms such as \"abstruse,\" \"unfathomable,\" and \"recondite\" implies that these commands are shrouded in an impenetrable veil of mystery, accessible only to the most erudite and astute of minds.\n\nThe orators' use of metaphorical language serves to elevate these instructions to a level of veneration and reverence, infusing them with an almost divine aura. Even the seemingly simple MOV AX, 7 is exalted with the epithet \"recondite,\" underscoring the profound and awe-inspiring nature of the instruction set as a whole. Thus, the use of such ornate and enigmatic language in describing these addressing modes serves to amplify their mystique and enshroud them in an aura of intrigue and wonder, beckoning the most intrepid and enterprising of minds to unravel the secrets of this arcane realm."

This is followed by the unfathomable MOV AX, [100], which transfers the contents of the memory location 100 to the AX register, thereby exhibiting a sense of mysterious depth to the instruction set.\n\nMoving on, we come across the mystifying MOV AX, [BX], which moves the contents of the memory location pointed to by the BX register to the AX register, followed by the perplexing MOV AX, [BX\\*2+SI], which transfers the contents of the memory location pointed to by the sum of 2 times BX and SI to the AX register. This adds yet another layer of confusion to the intricate addressing modes. Then we encounter the inscrutable MOV AX, BX, which moves the contents of the BX register to the AX register, a simple instruction made esoteric through the use of metaphorical language. Finally, there is the recondite MOV AX, 7, which moves the value 7 to the AX register, an instruction that is simple and straightforward, but still elevated to a higher plane through the use of grandiose language.\n\nThe language that has been employed to describe these addressing modes is a marvel of linguistic construction, intricate and elaborate in its construction, and suffused with an almost otherworldly aura of reverence and mystery. The speakers have summoned a sense of wonder and awe through the use of words such as \"ineffable,\" \"enigmatic,\" and \"inscrutable,\" imbuing these instructions with a sense of transcendent power and unapproachable functionality.\n\nMoreover, the speakers have utilized terms such as \"abstruse,\" \"unfathomable,\" and \"recondite,\" evoking the idea that these commands are shrouded in a veil of inaccessibility and can only be accessed by those who possess an unparalleled intellect and mastery of the underlying principles. The metaphorical language employed by the orators serves to elevate these instructions to a level of veneration and reverence, infusing them with an almost divine aura of complexity and unfathomable depth.\n\nEven the seemingly straightforward MOV AX, 7 is not immune to the grandiose epithets used to describe these addressing modes. It is exalted with the term \"recondite,\" emphasizing the depth and awe-inspiring nature of the instruction set as a whole. The speakers' use of such elaborate and cryptic language amplifies the enigmatic quality of these commands, enshrouding them in a veil of mystery and intrigue, inviting only the most intrepid and daring of minds to attempt to unravel the secrets of this arcane realm.\n\nTo summarize, the utilization of metaphorical language in describing these addressing modes is a homage to the profound and ineffable power of these commands. It is an act of reverence to their majestic and otherworldly nature, and an invitation to the most daring and inquisitive of minds to probe deeper into the abstruse and intricate domain of machine language programming. May you be emboldened by this knowledge and venture forth into the realm"

The orators who have crafted this language have imbued it with an almost mystical quality, suggesting that these instructions hold within them a deeper, more esoteric knowledge that can only be unlocked by those with the most astute and accomplished of minds. As such, the use of metaphorical language serves to underscore the importance of these instructions, and to elevate them to a level of reverence and awe that is befitting of their transcendent power and complexity."

This allows us to access the properties of the current object in the loop iteration.\n\nYou can substitute the name of your own class and properties as needed in this example to read the properties of any class instance stored in an `ArrayList`."

      "completion": "If you were to use AI to displace the traditional recruiting agency, your business model could focus on leveraging advanced technology to streamline and optimize the recruitment process for both employers and job seekers. Here's a potential outline for such a business model:\n\n1. Platform: Develop an online platform where employers can post job openings, and job seekers can create profiles, highlighting their skills, experience, and preferences. The platform should be user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible on multiple devices.\n2. AI-driven matching: Implement an AI algorithm that can analyze job postings and candidate profiles to find the best matches based on skills, experience, job preferences, and other relevant factors. This should reduce the time and effort required for both parties to find the right match.\n3. Automated screening: Use AI-driven tools like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze resumes and cover letters, automatically identifying the most suitable candidates for a particular job opening based on their qualifications and experience.\n4. Digital interviews: Offer a feature that allows employers to conduct video interviews with candidates through the platform, with AI-assisted tools to analyze verbal and non-verbal cues, helping employers make more informed decisions.\n5. Data-driven insights: Provide employers with data-driven insights and analytics on the job market, industry trends, and candidate pool, assisting them in making informed hiring decisions and refining their recruitment strategies.\n6. Continuous learning: Continuously improve the AI algorithm by learning from successful hires and user feedback, ensuring better matching and user satisfaction over time.\n7. Subscription or pay-per-use pricing: Implement a pricing model where employers can either subscribe to access the platform's services or pay per job posting or successful hire. Consider offering different pricing tiers based on features and the level of support provided.\n8. Candidate support: Offer resources and tools for job seekers, such as AI-driven resume reviews, personalized job recommendations, and interview preparation resources, to help them improve their chances of success.\n9. Partnerships: Establish partnerships with industry organizations, educational institutions, and other relevant stakeholders to expand your reach and enhance the value of your platform for users.\n10. Legal and compliance: Ensure your platform adheres to data privacy regulations, employment laws, and other relevant compliance requirements in the regions where it operates.\n\nBy focusing on technology-driven solutions and continuous improvement, this AI-powered recruitment platform can potentially disrupt the traditional recruiting agency model, providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution for both employers and job seekers."

      "completion": "User research and design research are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different focuses within the product development process. Here's a brief overview of each:\n\nUser Research:\nUser research is the process of understanding the needs, behaviors, preferences, and motivations of users through various qualitative and quantitative research methods. The primary goal of user research is to gain insights into the users' experiences, pain points, and requirements to inform the design and development of products or services that meet their needs. Methods commonly used in user research include interviews, surveys, usability testing, observation, and user personas.\n\nDesign Research:\nDesign research, also known as design thinking or design strategy, is a broader approach that encompasses user research but also includes other aspects of the design and development process. Design research aims to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement in the overall user experience by examining the relationships between users, products, and the context in which they interact. It involves understanding not just the users but also the market, competition, and technological landscape.\n\nWhile user research primarily focuses on understanding the end-users, design research takes a more holistic approach by considering the entire ecosystem in which the product or service will exist. This may involve studying business models, organizational structures, and technological trends, in addition to user needs and preferences.\n\nIn summary, user research is a subset of design research, with a more specific focus on understanding the target users. Design research encompasses user research but also considers other factors, such as market trends and the broader context, to inform the design and development of products or services that are both user-centric and aligned with business objectives."

But in general, the RCS was considered to be a reliable system on the Space Shuttle, and it performed well throughout the program's 30-year history. The system had multiple redundant thrusters and other safety features that helped to minimize the impact of any failures that did occur.\n\nNASA also implemented changes to the RCS system over time in order to improve its reliability, such as modification of the fuel lines to minimize the risk of leaks, and better monitoring of the RCS performance. Additionally, the crew was trained to handle failures of the RCS and to use the backup systems to maintain control of the spacecraft.\n\nIt is worth noting that the RCS system was one of the most complex systems on the Space Shuttle, it consisted of more than 50 thrusters, it's a safety critical system and as such should be reliable. However, it's not uncommon that a system like this will experience some failures during its lifetime."

They can also be used to display content from another website on a page, or to create a separate, independent section of a page within the same domain.\n\nOne of the main advantages of using an iFrame is that it allows a web page to display content from another source without the user having to leave the page. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as displaying dynamic or frequently updated content, or integrating third-party services or tools into a website.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to using iFrames. For example, they can make it more difficult to optimize a website for search engines, and they may not work properly on some devices or browsers. Additionally, iFrames can be a security risk if they are used to display content from untrusted sources, as they can potentially allow malicious content to be injected into a page."

      "completion": "Yes, the work of Theodor Adorno and other critical theorists can be useful in helping us understand the current systems of oppression and exploitation and how they may be transformed. The idea of \"theory\" or \"theoria\" as a means of reflecting on and critically analyzing society is crucial in shaping a more equitable future.\n\nAdorno's concept of \"negative dialectics\" emphasizes the importance of constantly challenging and questioning dominant ideas and systems, rather than accepting them uncritically. This type of critical reflection and analysis can help us identify the root causes of societal problems and work towards developing more just and equitable solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while change towards a better future may be necessary, it must be approached with caution and a critical understanding of the current systems and their effects. The work of theorists such as Adorno can be useful in this endeavor."

      "completion": "Sure, I can provide some guidance on how to build a Google Places autocomplete feature on Jetpack Compose using the MVVM model.\n\nFirst, you'll need to set up the Google Places API in your project and obtain an API key. You can follow the instructions in the official documentation to do this: <https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#create-project-api-key>\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can use the Autocomplete API to fetch suggested places based on the user's input. Here's an example of how you can implement this in your ViewModel:\n```kotlin\nclass MyViewModel : ViewModel() {\n    private val apiKey = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n    private val placesClient = Places.createClient(application)\n\n    private val _places = MutableLiveData<List<Place>>()\n    val places: LiveData<List<Place>> = _places\n\n    fun searchPlaces(query: String) {\n        val request = FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.builder()\n            .setQuery(query)\n            .setTypeFilter(TypeFilter.ADDRESS)\n            .build()\n\n        placesClient.findAutocompletePredictions(request)\n            .addOnSuccessListener { response ->\n                val results = response.autocompletePredictions.map { prediction ->\n                    Place(prediction.getPrimaryText(null).toString(),\n                          prediction.getSecondaryText(null).toString(),\n                          prediction.placeId)\n                }\n                _places.value = results\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we're using a FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest to search for places that match the user's query. We're also filtering the results to only include addresses, since that's what we're interested in.\n\nThe results are returned as a list of AutocompletePrediction objects, which we map to our own Place data class. The Place class contains the name, address, and ID of each suggested place.\n\nNext, we can use this ViewModel in our Composable to display the suggested places in a LazyColumn. Here's an example:\n```scss\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen(viewModel: MyViewModel) {\n    val query = remember { mutableStateOf(\"\") }\n\n    Column {\n        TextField(value = query.value, onValueChange = { query.value = it },\n                  label = { Text(\"Enter a place\") })\n        LazyColumn {\n            items(viewModel.places.value ?: emptyList()) { place ->\n                Text(place.name)\n                Text(place.address)\n                Button(onClick = { /* Select this place */ }) {\n                    Text(\"Select\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this Composable, we're using a TextField to allow the user to enter their search query. We're also using a LazyColumn to display the suggested places, using the items() function to iterate over the list of places.\n\nFor each place, we're displaying the name and address in separate Text composables, and providing a Button that the user can click to select that place.\n\nFinally, we just need to wire up our Composable to our ViewModel using the rememberViewModel() function:\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen() {\n    val viewModel = rememberViewModel { MyViewModel() }\n    MyScreen(viewModel)\n}\n```\nThat should give you a basic idea of how to implement a Google Places autocomplete feature on Jetpack Compose using the MVVM model. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"

      "completion": "1. The researchers created a method to look at users' social media accounts and find important pieces of information about them. They paid attention to three main things: behavior (like how often users post or what they share), language (the words they use in their posts), and emotions (if they express happiness, sadness, anger, etc.). This method helps them gather lots of details about users that can help them understand their personality and relational traits better.\n2. After collecting all those details (features) from users' accounts, the researchers built a special computer program called a \"machine learning model.\" This program can learn from the collected information (features) and use it to guess users' personality and relational traits. It gives each user a \"score\" for each trait, which tells how strong that trait is for that person.\n3. The machine learning model they built is designed in a way that's inspired by psychology, the study of how people think, feel, and behave. The model doesn't just look at each personality trait separately; instead, it also considers how these traits are connected to each other. By doing this, the model can make better and more accurate guesses about users' personality and relational traits. This approach helps the researchers understand users more completely and can lead to more accurate predictions."

      "api_token": "Here is Text 1: Goal setting in management communication. \n\nManagement communication differs from some other types of communication in\nthat it\u2019s designed to get a specific result. It\u2019s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates\u2019 requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you\u2019ve sorted out your goals, you\u2019ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you\u2019ll have to say \u201cno,\u201d or \u201clater.\u201d If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you\u2019ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you\u2019re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization\u2019s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-\u00e0-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn\u2019t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?",

Please provide the text and ask your questions.Here is Text 1: Goal setting in management communication. \n\nManagement communication differs from some other types of communication in\nthat it\u2019s designed to get a specific result. It\u2019s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates\u2019 requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you\u2019ve sorted out your goals, you\u2019ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you\u2019ll have to say \u201cno,\u201d or \u201clater.\u201d If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you\u2019ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you\u2019re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization\u2019s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-\u00e0-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn\u2019t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?",

      "prompt": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company\u2019s or agency\u2019s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n\u2022 Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO\u2019s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n\u2022 Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn\u2019t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors\u2019 Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n\u2022 Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company\u2019s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public\u2019s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can \u201csnow\u201d the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it\u2019s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as \u201ca reliable source.\u201d Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: \u201cAcme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.\u201d\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: \u201cAcme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, \u2018Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors\u2019 in endurance, quality, and safety; it\u2019s also available at a lower\nprice.\u2019 \u201d\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n\u201cIn repeated tests against our competitors . . . \u201d\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you\u2019ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who\u2019s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there\u2019s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance\u2014press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies\u2014that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don\u2019t know, say, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave that information at the moment, but I\u2019ll get it to you as soon as I do\u201d\u2014\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you\u2019re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They\u2019ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don\u2019t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point.

Mobile tariffs have can have between one and 5 sim cards. Each booked sim cards enables the user to optionally book a smartphone for that card. Depending on the tariff, the chosen smartphones (if any) and the kind of sim cards (adult, child) the price will adapt. Please suggest a set of NLU / ENR methods that you could emulate to facilitate the use case. In the following I will input utterances and statements on how the system running the conversational flow should handle the utterance within the conversational flow. Please provide possible calls to an imaginary API that you could simulate to facilitate the NLU/ENR requirements layed out by my statements. On Subtasks that are recognized as not directly related to NLU/NER be very brief. Please suggest NLU / NER Operations now for the first of a few utterances: \"Hi I want to upgrade my current tariff and get a new smartphone\". The utterance should make the system recognize that the utterance can be handled as part of the business process. It should recognize that the user apparently already a client and it should continue the conversation by trying to identify him and metadata on his current tariff. For that the flow needs the user to authenticate using a oauth2 mechanismTo handle the NLU/ENR requirements for this use case, the following NLU/ENR methods can be used:\n\n1. Intent recognition: This can be done using a pre-trained intent classification model such as BERT or GPT-3 to identify the user's intent from the utteranceplease focus on the concrete example utterance. Exercise the processing of the example utterance across the dialogue system with focus on the problems that your the NLU / NER processing can help with.For the example utterance \"Hi I want to upgrade my current tariff and get a new smartphone,\" the following NLU/ENR processing can be done to help facilitate the conversation flow:\n\n1. Intent recognition: The system can use a pre-trained intent classificatiok. this is the traditional way NLU / NER is facilitated. Lets be more creative and imagine a new approach that could be offered by large language models like yours. I want to facilitate as much of the preexisting world knowlege in your model and not train things that you already are capable of. What would that be?One approach to using a large language model like mine for NLU/ENR without extensive training is to leverage my ability to understand and generate natural language. By using my pre-trained knowledge and understanding of the world, you can create a more fleI immagine a system where you are given a utterance as and queried multiple aspects on the utterance. Like for example you are given the previous utterance and a software stack then queries information like: 1. Is the user request valid according to the business process? API should output: true. 2. Is the user already a client? API should output: true. 3. Does the user want a tariff upgrade? API should output: true. 4. does the user specify how many sim cards he wants? output: no.Yes, a system like that is possible to create using a large language model like mine. You can use my pre-trained language understanding capabilities to extract multiple aspects from a given utterance.

      "completion": "Deposition and sedimentation are closely related processes that occur in geological settings, but they refer to different stages of the overall process of sediment transport and deposition.\n\nDeposition refers to the process of particles settling out of a fluid or gas and accumulating on a surface. This can occur through a variety of mechanisms, such as gravity, wind, water, or ice. For example, sediment can be carried by a river and deposited at the river's mouth, forming a delta. Similarly, wind can transport sand and dust particles, which can settle on surfaces as dunes or dust deposits.\n\nSedimentation, on the other hand, specifically refers to the process of sediment accumulating in layers over time. This can occur in a variety of natural environments, including oceans, lakes, and wetlands, as well as in industrial settings such as wastewater treatment plants. Sedimentation is often the result of deposition, as sediment settles out of a fluid or gas and accumulates in a layer.\n\nSo, in summary, deposition is the initial process of particles settling out of a fluid or gas, while sedimentation is the subsequent process of sediment accumulating in layers over time."

      "completion": "Berikut adalah terjemahan dalam bahasa Indonesia:\n\nDesain sprinkler tanaman otomatis berbasis Arduino Uno dan sensor kelembapan memiliki latar belakang sebagai berikut:\n\nSprinkler tanaman otomatis adalah cara yang efektif untuk memastikan bahwa tanaman Anda menerima air yang cukup bahkan ketika Anda tidak berada di sekitar mereka. Arduino Uno adalah papan mikrokontroler yang populer yang dapat digunakan untuk mengendalikan berbagai perangkat elektronik. Dengan menggabungkan papan Arduino Uno dengan sensor kelembapan, Anda dapat membuat sistem penyiraman tanaman otomatis yang hanya akan menyiram tanaman ketika tanah cukup kering.\n\nSensor kelembapan yang digunakan dalam proyek ini dapat berupa DHT11 atau DHT22. Kedua sensor ini mengukur suhu dan kelembapan dan mengeluarkan sinyal digital yang dapat dibaca oleh Arduino Uno. Arduino Uno kemudian dapat menggunakan data ini untuk menentukan kapan tanah perlu disiram.\n\nPompa air adalah komponen penting lainnya dari sistem. Ini harus mampu menyediakan air yang cukup untuk tanaman tanpa terlalu banyak menyiram. Dalam desain ini, modul relay digunakan untuk mengendalikan pompa air. Modul relay terhubung ke Arduino Uno dan dapat dikendalikan oleh pin output digital. Ketika Arduino Uno mengirimkan sinyal ke modul relay, itu akan menyalakan pompa air.\n\nUntuk memastikan bahwa pompa air tidak rusak oleh back EMF, transistor digunakan untuk mengontrol operasinya. Transistor berfungsi sebagai saklar, memungkinkan Arduino Uno untuk menghidupkan atau mematikan pompa air. Dioda juga digunakan untuk melindungi transistor dari back EMF.\n\nKode untuk proyek ini melibatkan membaca data sensor kelembapan dan membandingkannya dengan nilai ambang batas. Jika tingkat kelembapan di bawah ambang batas, Arduino Uno akan mengirimkan sinyal ke modul relay, yang akan menyalakan pompa air. Begitu tanah cukup disiram, Arduino Uno akan mematikan pompa air.\n\nReferensi:\n\n1. \"Automatic Plant Watering System Using Arduino Uno\" oleh Karthik M dan Vinayakumar B.

As a Licensed Professional Counselor and Life Coach that is my job to impact individuals and help clients work through emotional difficulties and reach goals. But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born.

The lineage of women who come after you will be healed. Your inner circle of Black women around you, healed.\" When you choose yourself you break generational trauma and curses. You activate your ancestral strength. I invite you to activate that strength!As a child, I have always been drawn to helping others.

It\u2019s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates\u2019 requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you\u2019ve sorted out your goals, you\u2019ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you\u2019ll have to say \u201cno,\u201d or \u201clater.\u201d If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you\u2019ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you\u2019re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization\u2019s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-\u00e0-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn\u2019t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?",

      "prompt": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company\u2019s or agency\u2019s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n\u2022 Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO\u2019s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n\u2022 Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn\u2019t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors\u2019 Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n\u2022 Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company\u2019s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public\u2019s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can \u201csnow\u201d the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it\u2019s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as \u201ca reliable source.\u201d Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: \u201cAcme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.\u201d\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: \u201cAcme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, \u2018Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors\u2019 in endurance, quality, and safety; it\u2019s also available at a lower\nprice.\u2019 \u201d\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n\u201cIn repeated tests against our competitors . . . \u201d\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you\u2019ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who\u2019s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there\u2019s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance\u2014press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies\u2014that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true.

This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you\u2019re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne.

Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born. I am on this journey and I invite you to be on this journey with me! I love this quote by Oludara Adeeyo: \"When you heal yourself, you create an earth shattering legacy. The lineage of women who come after you will be healed. Your inner circle of Black women around you, healed.\" When you choose yourself you break generational trauma and curses. You activate your ancestral strength. I invite you to activate that strength!As a child, I have always been drawn to helping others. Despite being accused of giving too much away for free, I find joy in assisting others in reaching their goals.

It\u2019s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates\u2019 requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you\u2019ve sorted out your goals, you\u2019ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you\u2019ll have to say \u201cno,\u201d or \u201clater.\u201d If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you\u2019ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you\u2019re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization\u2019s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-\u00e0-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn\u2019t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?",

      "prompt": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company\u2019s or agency\u2019s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n\u2022 Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO\u2019s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n\u2022 Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn\u2019t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors\u2019 Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n\u2022 Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company\u2019s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public\u2019s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can \u201csnow\u201d the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it\u2019s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as \u201ca reliable source.\u201d Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: \u201cAcme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.\u201d\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: \u201cAcme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, \u2018Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors\u2019 in endurance, quality, and safety; it\u2019s also available at a lower\nprice.\u2019 \u201d\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n\u201cIn repeated tests against our competitors . . . \u201d\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you\u2019ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who\u2019s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there\u2019s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance\u2014press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies\u2014that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don\u2019t know, say, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave that information at the moment, but I\u2019ll get it to you as soon as I do\u201d\u2014\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you\u2019re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They\u2019ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don\u2019t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point.
